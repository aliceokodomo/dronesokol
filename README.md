# dronesokol
here is an index.html including pictogram of social network in the footer. 
This exercice is the first collaborative exercice at Descodeuses.
The theme is about drones and we had to make a prototype in 12 hours with only HTML and CSS, and two colors prescribed.
We were four of us, and used tools such as Trello, Zeplin, Atom, Pencil.
